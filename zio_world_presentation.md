# Situation

Joined Ziverge

ZIO 2.0 approaches!

We need the community to build on it!

---

# Questions

"Who is publishing on the 2.x releases?"

"Who is working towards a release?"

"Can we track this?"

---
# Constructing an elegant Alpha

---
# Excel-lent

---
# Excel Downsides
- Tables only take you so far
- Manually-entered data is stale immediately

---

# Win - Got a colleague interested

---
# Fun Graphs

# Graph Downsides 

- Output requires hand-tuning
- Still hectic

---

# Win - We highlighted connections

---

# Next up, automation

---
# Core Logic
- Find the latest release of project on Maven
- Extract dependencies from POM file
- Slam everything into a graph

---
###  Terminal Velocity

Built with ZIO-cli

---
### Terminal Downsides

- You have to view in a terminal
- Built 3 views before I got annoyed
- Useful, but not _easy_

# To the Web!

# Cool, but I need to be at the computer
